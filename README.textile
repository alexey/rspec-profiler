h1. rspec-profiler

_Currently_ _tested_ _only_ _for_ _rspec-2.11_

The rspec-profiler is a custom formatter that adds functionality to the existing --profile option in
rspec. The rspec-profiler first groups tests together by their folder under the spec directory
(models, lib, controllers, etc...). Then the standarAd deviation is calculated. Any test within a
group that is 2 or more standard deviations away from the mean is listed as slow.

There are downsides of course to doing it this way. Obviously with a mean of .02 seconds and a
standarddeviation of .01 seconds, a test that takes .04 seconds will be marked as slow when perhaps
one wouldn't categorize that particular test as necessarily being slow. I will simply advise, as
with any benchmark, to not take the results too seriously, rather, you should use the results as a
means to identify tests that are unecessarily slow.

h2. Installation

1. Put the profiler in your @Gemfile@

2. When running your specs use:

bc. $ rspec --format Profiler -p spec

Alternatively, you can make the Profiler formatter your default formatter by modify your @.rspec@
file:

bc. --format Profiler

_Note_: The performance profile will not display unless you specify the @-p@ option when running
rspec. Additionally, when tests fail, the profile will not display.
