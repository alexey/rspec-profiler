h1. rspec-profiler

_Currently_ _tested_ _only_ _for_ _rspec-2.11_

The rspec-profiler is a custom formatter that adds functionality to the existing --profile option in
rspec. The rspec-profiler first groups tests together by their folder under the spec directory
(models, lib, controllers, etc...). Then the standarAd deviation is calculated. Any test within a
group that is 2 or more standard deviations away from the mean is listed as slow.

There are downsides of course to doing it this way. For example, with a mean of .02 seconds and a
standard deviation of .01 seconds, a test that takes .04 seconds will be marked as 'slow' when perhaps
one wouldn't categorize that particular test as necessarily being slow. I will simply advise, as
with any benchmark, to not take the results too seriously. Rather, you should use the results as a
way to identify tests that perhaps need to be looked at.

h2. Installation

1. Put the profiler in your @Gemfile@

2. When running your specs use:

bc. $ rspec --format Profiler -p spec

If for some reason rspec cannot find the Profiler, you case use the @-r@ option and provid the PATH
to the Profiler.

Alternatively, you can make the Profiler formatter your default formatter by modifying your @.rspec@
file:

bc. --format Profiler

_Note_: The performance profile will not display unless you specify the @-p@ option when running
rspec. Additionally, when tests fail, the profile will not display which is consistant with how the
bundled profiler works as well.

_If you use Timecop_: If you use the timecop gem to freeze or change time be sure to also return the
time after each of your tests. Not doing so will make it appear as if your tests are taking either
far too long or have taken negative time to complete.
