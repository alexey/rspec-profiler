{"body":"h1. rspec-profiler\r\n\r\n_Currently_ _tested_ _only_ _for_ _rspec-2.11_\r\n\r\nThe rspec-profiler is a custom formatter that adds functionality to the existing --profile option in\r\nrspec. The rspec-profiler first groups tests together by their folder under the spec directory\r\n(models, lib, controllers, etc...). Then the standarAd deviation is calculated. Any test within a\r\ngroup that is 2 or more standard deviations away from the mean is listed as slow.\r\n\r\nThere are downsides of course to doing it this way. Obviously with a mean of .02 seconds and a\r\nstandarddeviation of .01 seconds, a test that takes .04 seconds will be marked as slow when perhaps\r\none wouldn't categorize that particular test as necessarily being slow. I will simply advise, as\r\nwith any benchmark, to not take the results too seriously, rather, you should use the results as a\r\nmeans to identify tests that are unecessarily slow.\r\n\r\nh2. Installation\r\n\r\n1. Put the profiler in your @Gemfile@\r\n\r\n2. When running your specs use:\r\n\r\nbc. $ rspec --format Profiler -p spec\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can make the Profiler formatter your default formatter by modify your @.rspec@\r\nfile:\r\n\r\nbc. --format Profiler\r\n\r\n_Note_: The performance profile will not display unless you specify the @-p@ option when running\r\nrspec. Additionally, when tests fail, the profile will not display.\r\n","google":"","tagline":"A better way to benchmark rspec and cucumber tests","note":"Don't delete this file!
